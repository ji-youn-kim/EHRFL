## Overview
In this study, we provide solutions to two practical yet overlooked scenarios in federated learning for electronic health records (EHRs): firstly, we introduce EHRFL, a framework that facilitates federated learning across healthcare institutions with distinct medical coding systems and database schemas using text-based linearization of EHRs. 
Secondly, we focus on a scenario where a single healthcare institution initiates federated learning to build a model tailored for itself, in which the number of clients must be optimized in order to reduce expenses incurred by the host. For selecting participating clients, we present a novel precision-based method, leveraging data latents to identify suitable participants for the institution.
Our empirical results show that EHRFL effectively enables federated learning across hospitals with different EHR systems. 
Furthermore, our results demonstrate the efficacy of our precision-based method in selecting 
reduced number of participating clients without compromising model performance, resulting in lower operational costs when constructing institution-specific models.
We believe this work lays a foundation for the broader adoption of federated learning on EHRs.
